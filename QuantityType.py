    """
    Physical quantities sharing some aspects are arbitrarily subdivided into different quantity types. They don't have
    to share the same units or even the same dimension. Example: wave length and the diameter of a pipe are both
    physical quantities corresponding to a length. Precipitation depth can also be measured as a length but dividing
    it into a quantity type is arbitrary.
